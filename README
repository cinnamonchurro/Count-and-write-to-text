Write a program called alice_words.py that creates a text file named alice_words.txt containing an alphabetical listing of all the words, and the number of times each occurs, in the text version of Aliceâ€™s Adventures in Wonderland. (You can obtain a free plain text version of the book, along with many others, from http://www.gutenberg.org.) The first 10 lines of your output file should look something like this
word        Count
a           631
a-piece     1
abide       1
able        1
about       94
above       3
absence     1
absurd      2
How many times does the word, alice, occur in the book? If you are writing this in the activecode window simply print out the results rather than write them to a file.
